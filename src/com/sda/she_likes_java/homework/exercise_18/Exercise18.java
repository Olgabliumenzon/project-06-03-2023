//Exercise 18.
//Create an Airplane class that provides the following operations:
//- takeOff
//- land
//- flyTo(int xCoordinates, int yCoordinates)
//- retrieve the current state of the aeroplane (flies/waits in hangar)
//When implementing, remember that:
//- the aircraft must be in the air to land
//- you cannot take off if you are already in the air
//- use variables to store internal state
//- check the use of your class in the main method
//- have fun
